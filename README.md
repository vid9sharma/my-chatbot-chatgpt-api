## Overview
This project is a demonstration of the concepts and skills I acquired from the Udemy course "Generative AI for Beginners." It showcases the development of a generative AI chatbot using OpenAI APIs, trained with specific documentation to answer questions based on that information.

## Features
- Custom Training: Train large language models (LLMs) with your specific documentation.
- Generative AI: Create a chatbot capable of generating responses based on the trained documentation.
- OpenAI Integration: Leverage OpenAI APIs to enhance the chatbot's capabilities.

## Project Details
In this project, I followed a structured approach to build a generative AI chatbot. The steps include:

- Data Preparation: Collect and preprocess the documentation to be used for training.
- Model Training: Utilize OpenAI APIs to train the LLM with the prepared data.
- Chatbot Development: Implement the chatbot that interacts with users and provides responses based on the trained model.

## Usage
Once the chatbot is running, you can upload your document and interact with it by asking questions related to the trained documentation. The chatbot will generate responses based on the context provided by the documentation.
